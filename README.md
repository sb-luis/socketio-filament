# Filament

A real-time private-messaging application built with NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and Socket.io. Any user can search, add, message & delete friends in real-time.

Everyone has the ability to see if their contacts are online. When a user deletes their account, all their conversations dissapear from the database.

This project was a great opportunity to learn more about input validation, authentication, authorisation, sessions & databases, while also experimenting with web sockets.
